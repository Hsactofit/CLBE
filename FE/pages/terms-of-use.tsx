          <p style={styles.p}>
            We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.6 Third-Party Obligations</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Any third parties with whom we share your information are contractually bound to adhere

            information (including de-identified or anonymized data) is prohibited without your
            active consent.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.7 Change in Ownership</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            If Crossing is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its

          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.8 Policy Changes</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>

            modifications.
          </p>

          <h2 style={styles.h2}>6. Fees and Payment</h2>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>6.1 Service Fees</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            While Crossing makes a large amount of information available without cost, we charge
            fees for some of our services ("Service Fees"). All Service Fees will be clearly set
            forth on the Sites.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>6.2 Government Fees</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            USCIS, USDOS, and other agencies charge fees for the filing and processing of various
            government forms ("Government Fees"). Government Fees are separate from our Service Fees
            and must be paid to the applicable government agency at the time of filing.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Unless you have purchased a Crossing service whereby we have agreed to remit the
            applicable Government Fees on your behalf, you remain responsible for paying Government
            Fees directly to the applicable government agency.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Because government agencies change their fees from time to time, the Government Fees
            required at the time your application is ready to be filed may be different from the
            Government Fees communicated to you at the time you purchased our Services. If the
            applicable Government Fees have increased, Crossing reserves the right to require
            payment of the difference between the Government Fees originally communicated to you and
            the Government Fees required at the time your application is filed.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>6.3 Payment Methods</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            When you purchase services for which Service Fees apply, you will be required to provide
            Crossing with valid, up-to-date credit card or other payment information. You authorize
            Crossing to charge your credit card or other payment method for all Service Fees you
            incur as they become due and payable.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>6.4 Payment Responsibility</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment information. If we cannot charge
            you for Service Fees when due because your payment information is incorrect or no longer
            valid, or if we do not receive your payment when due, Crossing will have no obligation
            to provide the services associated with those Service Fees.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>6.5 Refunds and Credits</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Please refer to our Satisfaction Guarantee policy for information about refunds. All
            refund or credit requests must be made within 14 days of purchase. The determination of
            whether to issue a refund or credit more than 14 days after your purchase of services,
            other than a refund due to a billing error by Crossing, shall be made in Crossing's sole
            discretion, in good faith, and we reserve the right to deny a request for a refund or
            credit.
          </p>

            any of the Crossing Content, the Sites, or any related software.

          <p style={styles.p}>
            Most disputes can be resolved without resort to legal proceedings. For any dispute or

            us at support@crossinglegal.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute informally.

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>12.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and Crossing agree to resolve any and all
            disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service,
            the Service, or any other aspect of our relationship ("Claims") through final and
            binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in
            accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>

            The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award
            <br />
            You and Crossing agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its
            individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
            representative proceeding.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>12.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            You and Crossing agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its
            individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
            representative proceeding. Unless both you and Crossing agree otherwise, the arbitrator
            may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any
            form of a representative or class proceeding.
